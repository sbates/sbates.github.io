Sorry, no picture. This was on the run with friends.

Macchiato is a local two-shop chain in NY. It's a restaurant as well as coffee
bar and appears to have a brisk lunch crowd. Seating is small tables and
chairs. This was a spontaneous stop after having lunch with friends near Times
Square. We stood in a long but efficient line. I was alarmed at the amount of
milk they poured in my 12oz drink and thought it would taste more like milk
than coffee.  While I would have preferred less milk, the taste was still
sweet, I could still taste coffee and the micro foam was lovely.  The
temperature of the drink was fine without a sleeve and the taste was nicely
sweet, leading me to suspect they probably use local and/or premium milk.
I prefer my caps with less milk, but if you aren't picky about lattes vs caps,
you'll probably like it. If I'd actually ordered a macchiato, it probably would
have been lovely. 

**Pros**: Fast service, lovely taste, great micro foam  
**Cons**: Busy and lacking in attention to detail.  

Final word: I would go here if I were near but wouldn't go out of my way to get
some and I might look around for something different if I were planning ahead.
It makes me interested in checking out Fonte Coffee Roasters in Seattle!
