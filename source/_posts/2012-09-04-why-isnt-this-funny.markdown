  I've seen this captioned image circulating all day on Twitter. For the
  record, I don't think this picture is funny.

  Now I love me some snark. But I think it's too easy to be
  snarky and mean on Twitter,  because there isn't a lot of consequence and we
  tend to live within a circle of our peers who often think alike.  The snark
  factor often goes up around conference time when many of us are congregating
  in once place and competing to sound smart and funny in 140 characters or
  less. I've commented before that I think people are too often mean on Twitter
  in the name of being witty or complaining about speakers without ever
  thinking about what that speaker might feel if he sees that tweet later.

  So why does this caption bother me? I have a long history of unfiltered snark
  and smart ass remarks. Consulting since 2006 taught me a lot about active
  filtering and my introduction to DevOps caused me to implement additional filtering for the
  sake of my emotional attachment to an ideal. 

  As someone who's signed on as a big fan of DevOps culture, I spend a lot of
  patrolling my cynicism and preventing disparaging remarks from escaping the
  filter. I think when you espouse certain ideals, you're responsible all the
  time for representing them. 

  I sometimes see cynical, catty remarks about sysadmins or ops from people who
  can only have come from a long life of development and, even though I haven't
  technically done ops in 7 years, I've been sysadminly all my long life and
  I am affronted every time by those remarks. Recently I heard a professional dev
  say to someone in a beginners programming workshop, "If you want
  to understand/master the install of the programming tools, you're probably
  better off as a sysadmin not a programmer." The guy who said is a super nice
  guy, but that remark still got a side-eye from me.

  If DevOps is a movement that promotes collaboration, communication, respect
  and friendship between functional teams, I don't think a sincere proponent
  would post this kind of caption. While it makes some folks feel validated,
  it's just fueling the fire that walls people off from each other.  I don't
  think we can all get along when folks are throwing up cynical remarks
  perpetuating stereotypes of bad development practices.

  While there are many successful DevOps teams out there, there are far more
  silos in transition or bitter adversaries who haven't yet heard of DevOps.
  I can't believe that only some developers or sysadmins are capable of transcending the usual barriers;
  I have to believe that any and all are able to transcend them or what's the
  point?   But it's the more entrenched and cynical cases that will be the most
  difficult to move ideologically and emotionally and I feel that humor like
  this can only alienate.

  I don't want to pick on anyone specifically because I see this kind of humor
  from all disciplines all the time and it makes me increasingly uncomfortable each
  time. If we're actually going to all be in this together, we need to jump in
  with both feet. So I thought I would speak up for a moment and say something.
  If a thing can only be funny by being rude about someone else, maybe it's not
  actually funny at all.
