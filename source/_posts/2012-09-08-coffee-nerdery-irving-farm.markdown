Verdict: Noms. Seems like a lot of places in NYC are serving Intelligentsia
coffee.  While I don't object necessarily, it's nice to see a coffee shop using
locally roasted or even better, roasting its own.  My drink was mild and
reminded me a bit of Stumptown with it's citric tinge. They heated the milk
a bit more than some places but it was still drinkable and I like my milk with
a smidge of heat so the drink doesn't cool off too soon. I'm guessing they heat
to 145-150.

There are four small tables and a wall bench at this location, so the lounge
factor isn't high.  However, the was an elderly man enjoying his newspaper
when I got here and so I'm guessing foot traffic isn't too obnoxious.
The shop is small and unassuming from the outside and I wouldn't have noticed
except I got off the subway there and was looking for friends.

Fyi, no public bathroom

**Final Word**: Noms.
