[La Colombe](http://lacolombe.com)  
**Location**: New York, NoHo@400 Lafayette  
**Espresso**: La Colombe  
**Machines**: La Marzocco & Mazzer  
**Coffee Art**: yes  
**Wifi**: unknown  
**Served in**: 8oz ceramic   
**Drink**: skim cap  
**Visited**: 9/2/12  

This was a quick stop while out shopping with a friend. There's ample seating
and it's a light, airy space. My coffee was ok, although it was a smidge
bitter. I'd probably have to try again to see how I liked the coffee.
However, it's a great place, good for meeting a friend or stopping in and
they take their coffee production pretty seriously. I didn't actually see
a menu anywhere although I wasn't looking. 

They did have an adorable water "fountain" that offered room temperature,
cold or carbonated water and they'll offer you a water cup no problem.  The
staff is professional and fast. This coffee shop had the most starbucksian
feel to it of all the shops I've been too, but I don't really mean that in
a derogatory way. I just mean that they turned out product quickly. The
product they turned out was definitely far superior to anything Starbucks
will serve you. I still prefer low-lit, shabby, hipster joints, but I'd have
no problem coming back here.

**Pros**: Fast, good coffee  
**Cons**: None really
