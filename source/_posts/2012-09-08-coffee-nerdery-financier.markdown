This drink had the potential to taste good.  Unfortunately the
barista had no concept of micro foam or craftsmanship. The taste is a little harsh but I can see
that it could taste awesome if prepared correctly. 

Financier prepares and roasts their own beans and so I may come back again and
check as it has the advantage of being close to where I'm staying and the
subway stations are totally horked with construction this weekend. (n.b.
I didn't. I walked to Kaffe 1668 in search of a sure thing).

The pasty case looks amazing but I won't be able to report on that. The store
has long bar seating at the window plus some table in the back. While
I prefer the dark hipster coffee shops, this is still ok.  The music is kind
of pop/r&b dreadful. There's no public bathroom either btw.

Also, beware, a small cappuccino is really only one shot. They divide the
shots. When I saw that, I asked for the second. This annoyed me.


**Pros**: cap tastes good despite mangled prep, bright and airy if you like that,
PASTRIES!  
**Cons**: Inexperienced baristas, Split shots (who are you, Starbucks?), crappy wifi

**Final word**: Beats Starbucks and the nearby Blue Spoon
