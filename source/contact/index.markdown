#### I'm easy to find on the interwebs. 
* *Twitter*: [sascha_d](https://twitter.com/#!/sascha_d) - Get your daily dose of snark.
* *IRC*: sascha_d - Find me in #chef and ##infra-talk mostly.
* *About Me*: I have an About Me page on here. It's empty, but not because I'm boring! I'll fill it in soon.
* *Github*: Of course I have a [github page](https://github.com/sbates). All the cool kids do. 
* *Email*: You can always email me at <sbates@brattyredhead.com>
* *LinkedIn*: Please review my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/saschabates) if you're curious about mundane things like professional history and what colleges didn't kick me out. Actually, one on the list kicked me out of the dorms when I was a freshman, but that was so long ago. No really. Don't judge me.
