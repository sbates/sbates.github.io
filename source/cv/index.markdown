## DevOps Enthusiast, Automator of Things
## Objective
  Never to be bored
## Personal Profile
I have over 10 years of IT experience, mainly in infrastructure design, build and automation, as well as complementary skills in *nix system administration and extensive problem solving experience. In the late 90’s I was pursuing a degree in Medieval Literature when I was drawn into full time technology work during the Internet Boom. I never looked back. Not only do I bring several years of technical experience, but also a solid communication skill set that allows me to speak clearly to all levels of technical background.
## Background
Buzzwords?
## Professional Experience
### Principal Consultant - Bratty Redhead Consulting, July 2011
#### Recent Project Overview
* I write the O’Reilly Web Ops and Performance Newsletter (email only) http://radar.oreilly.com/webops
* Multiphase POC to design and build a manifest-driven deploy toolchain for hosted VMware applications using Chef Solo, Jenkins, Rundeck and VMware tools on both Ubuntu and Windows
* Project to automate ATG10/JBoss5 with Puppet for a small hosting/consulting shop
* ATG 9/JBoss 4.3 Dual retail applications - production environment standup
  * Given zero documentation and aggressive deadlines, I designed and built the application production layout for two applications sharing hardware. Components included Apache, mod_jk, ATG Search and BCC install/config. Along the way I abstracted jboss port management, wrote a management script, hacked together a deployment script, while also providing detailed documentation on JBoss slimming, optimization and build instructions.
* ATG 10/JBoss 5.1 all environments design/build/automate/support
  * Worked with the lead developer to design environment layouts, pushed for a documentation wiki that became wildly popular and stood up a monitoring dashboard(m/monit) and external log reader (Graylog2) to enable developers where they weren't allowed access to servers.
