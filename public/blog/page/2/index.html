<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: As a sysadmin, whenever someone tweets something snarky about sysadmins,
I feel a little put down. As a result, I try to think twice about snarky stuff
I might tweet about devs or other teams. And so, I think sysadmins posting snarky captioned
images about devs and then adding the devops hashtag is mean and
inappropriate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this captioned image circulating all day with the devops hashtag on Twitter. For the
record, I don&#8217;t think this picture is funny. In the right context, it might
be funny. If it were, say, a slide in a deck pointing to how things are or
used to be without devops, I&#8217;d laugh. My issue is seeing tweeted with the devops hashtag
and having it billed as funny.</p>

<p>Now I love me some snark. But I think it&#8217;s too easy to be
snarky and mean on Twitter,  because there isn&#8217;t a lot of consequence and we
tend to live within a circle of our peers who often think alike.  The snark
factor often goes up around conference time when many of us are congregating
in once place and competing to sound smart and funny in 140 characters or
less. I&#8217;ve commented before that I think people are too often mean on Twitter
in the name of being witty or complaining about speakers without ever
thinking about what that speaker might feel if he sees that tweet later.</p>

<p>So why does this caption bother me? I have a long history of unfiltered snark
and smart ass remarks. Consulting since 2006 taught me a lot about active
filtering and my introduction to DevOps caused me to implement additional filtering for the
sake of my emotional attachment to an ideal.</p>

<p>As someone who&#8217;s signed on as a big fan of DevOps culture, I spend a lot of
patrolling my cynicism and preventing disparaging remarks from escaping the
filter. I think when you espouse certain ideals, you&#8217;re responsible all the
time for representing them.</p>

<p>I sometimes see cynical, catty remarks about sysadmins or ops from people who
can only have come from a long life of development and, even though I haven&#8217;t
technically done ops in 7 years, I&#8217;ve been sysadminly all my long life and
I am affronted every time by those remarks. Recently I heard a professional dev
say to someone in a beginners programming workshop, &#8220;If you want
to understand/master the install of the programming tools, you&#8217;re probably
better off as a sysadmin not a programmer.&#8221; The guy who said is a super nice
guy, but that remark still got a side-eye from me.</p>

<p>If DevOps is a movement that promotes collaboration, communication, respect
and friendship between functional teams, I don&#8217;t think a sincere proponent
would post this kind of caption. While it makes some folks feel validated,
it&#8217;s just fueling the fire that walls people off from each other.  I don&#8217;t
think we can all get along when folks are throwing up cynical remarks
perpetuating stereotypes of bad development practices.</p>

<p>While there are many successful DevOps teams out there, there are far more
silos in transition or bitter adversaries who haven&#8217;t yet heard of DevOps.
I can&#8217;t believe that only some developers or sysadmins are capable of transcending the usual barriers;
I have to believe that any and all are able to transcend them or what&#8217;s the
point?   But it&#8217;s the more entrenched and cynical cases that will be the most
difficult to move ideologically and emotionally and I feel that humor like
this can only alienate.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to pick on anyone specifically because I see this kind of humor
from all disciplines all the time and it makes me increasingly uncomfortable each
time. If we&#8217;re actually going to all be in this together, we need to jump in
with both feet. So I thought I would speak up for a moment and say something.
If a thing can only be funny by being rude about someone else, maybe it&#8217;s not
actually funny at all.</p>

<p>This was a quick stop while out shopping with a friend. There&#8217;s ample seating
and it&#8217;s a light, airy space. My coffee was ok, although it was a smidge
bitter. I&#8217;d probably have to try again to see how I liked the coffee.
However, it&#8217;s a great place, good for meeting a friend or stopping in and
they take their coffee production pretty seriously. I didn&#8217;t actually see
a menu anywhere although I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>

<p>They did have an adorable water &#8220;fountain&#8221; that offered room temperature,
cold or carbonated water and they&#8217;ll offer you a water cup no problem.  The
staff is professional and fast. This coffee shop had the most starbucksian
feel to it of all the shops I&#8217;ve been too, but I don&#8217;t really mean that in
a derogatory way. I just mean that they turned out product quickly. The
product they turned out was definitely far superior to anything Starbucks
will serve you. I still prefer low-lit, shabby, hipster joints, but I&#8217;d have
no problem coming back here.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast, good coffee<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: None really</p>

<strong>Location</strong>: near Times Square<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Macchiatto 44 roasted by Seattle-based Fonte Micro Roasters<br/>

<p>Sorry, no picture. This was on the run with friends.</p>

<p>Macchiato is a local two-shop chain in NY. It&#8217;s a restaurant as well as coffee
bar and appears to have a brisk lunch crowd. Seating is small tables and
chairs. This was a spontaneous stop after having lunch with friends near Times
Square. We stood in a long but efficient line. I was alarmed at the amount of
milk they poured in my 12oz drink and thought it would taste more like milk
than coffee.  While I would have preferred less milk, the taste was still
sweet, I could still taste coffee and the micro foam was lovely.  The
temperature of the drink was fine without a sleeve and the taste was nicely
sweet, leading me to suspect they probably use local and/or premium milk.
I prefer my caps with less milk, but if you aren&#8217;t picky about lattes vs caps,
you&#8217;ll probably like it. If I&#8217;d actually ordered a macchiato, it probably would
have been lovely.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast service, lovely taste, great micro foam<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Busy and lacking in attention to detail.</p>

<p>Final word: I would go here if I were near but wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to get
some and I might look around for something different if I were planning ahead.
I think 12oz cups are way too big for most drinks, but it did taste good, so
YMMV.  It makes me interested in checking out Fonte Coffee Roasters in Seattle!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bluespooncoffee.com/">Blue Spoon</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Downtown (Williams and Platt)<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Intelligentsia<br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: La Marzocco + Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: yes, from the park across the street (NY DTA), sketchy<br/>
<strong>Served In</strong>: 8oz cardboard<br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 8/31/2012</p>

<p><img src="/images/bluespoon.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a small shop at corner of William and Platt in the Financial
District.  The coffee is too hot leading me to guess they overcook the milk. I ate
half a bagel waiting for it to cool off. If I had been walking, I would have
wanted a sleeve, which I generally never need with artisan coffee joints. It
was interesting that the beans were Intelligentsia as the taste seemed to
have a lot more licorice or citrus than the other locations serving the same
beans. Reminded me a bit of Stumptown when it&#8217;s pulled too long.</p>

<p>Other, non-coffee specific: It&#8217;s hot in here. It&#8217;s a very small space and
I think there&#8217;s some a/c near the counter, but I&#8217;m about 8 feet away at
a window bar and sweating while drinking my coffee. Also, despite ordering
&#8220;for here,&#8221; I received cups with lids on them and a bagel toasted but wrapped
up in wax paper and a lunch bag.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: They&#8217;re 2 blocks from where I&#8217;m staying and bagel noms.<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: scalded milk, bitter, citric taste, location heat.</p>

<p>Followup: It was 90 degrees Friday afternoon, so I opted to walk back here
despite the meh experience of the morning.  I got the same kind of drink that
I think had even more milk than my morning cups. Very disappointing
experience for a shop that actually has a La Marzocco in residence.</p>

<p>Final word: Despite the La Marzocco, this shop is not serving artisan coffee
and I don&#8217;t recommend it. It beats Starbucks, but just barely. Intelligentsia
should investigate the crimes being committed against their beans in this location.</p>

<strong>Location:</strong> New York, Tribeca a few blocks from the GZ Memorial<br/>

<strong>Coffee Art:</strong> Yes<br/>

<p>  <img src="/images/kaffe1668.jpg"/><br/>
 This coffee shop was recommended to me by a casual Facebook friend who moved to NYC
 from Minneapolis and used to be a barista himself.</p>

<p> Kaffe 1668 is a lovely little shop with dark wood tables and benches. It&#8217;s
 quite dim inside and I really like it. They serve espresso drinks and
 individually brewed coffee.  My cappuccinos were low temperature and actually
 cooled rather quickly as I was lollygagging.  However, they were very good and
 I enjoyed every drop. In a world where too many drinks are made with scalded
 milk, I&#8217;m ok with the consequences of low temps. The shop has cold pastries.
 I had a scone on my first visit and a breakfast sandwich on a baguette on the
 next. The scone was good, the baguette was chewy(I know nothing about french
breads so take that fwiw).</p>

<p> Your wait for coffee can be significant. The line moved a bit slow and it
 took a while for my drinks to be made.  However, it&#8217;s worth it as the
 baristas are perfectionists and won&#8217;t serve a substandard drink. On my first
 visit I was informed that my second cup was late because they were remaking
 it.   I understand they recalibrate espresso pulls throughout the day here
 which is awesome.</p>

<p> One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to be a stroller destination on
 Saturday mornings. It&#8217;s still worth it for good coffee which seems to be
 missing in most of Downtown, but cranky babies can be a bit tough on the ears
 in the early morning.</p>

<p> Bonus: They&#8217;re open on Labor Day. Guess where I&#8217;m going when I get up
 tomorrow?</p>

for traveling nerds. I don&#8217;t travel extensively but I do go places and my trip
logistics are often driven by my need for acceptable espresso drinks. Over the
years I&#8217;ve raised the bar several times for what I want in a coffee shop. I used to just get excited that
I could find Starbucks on road trips through Nebraska and Oklahoma or had
a Starbucks across the street from my hotel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just want to take a moment to point you at an epic new Chef cookbook undertaking. John Larsen has been working on a <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/atg">cookbook to configure a full ATG stack with JBoss</a> and has finished a first version. This is something I always wanted to work on but never got around to, and so I&#8217;m being extra appreciative of someone who did take the time to get it working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has been percolating in my brain for a long time. I mean like, long. Ever since I <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style-Guide+Outline">read a snippet</a> from last year&#8217;s Chef Summit discussing best practices regarding attributes, I&#8217;ve wanted to write something. But what I&#8217;ve got to say keeps changing.</p>

<p>This post assumes some basic familiarity with Chef and node attributes. I assume that most people are going to be bored with the subject matter unless you care about nerdy details or why strings are the official preferred notation. You can get the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Attributes#CookbookAttributes-Notation">short version</a> on the Chef Wiki Cookbook Attributes page. I have a longer discussion here that focuses on my discovery process and evolution of thought.</p>

<h4>A Quick Attribute Notation Overview</h4>

<p>When I first started working with Chef, the publicly available cookbooks and wiki documentation were written in different styles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some used <strong>symbols</strong>: node[:some][:symbol]</li>
<li>some used <strong>strings</strong>: node[&#8216;some&#8217;][&#8216;string&#8217;]</li>
<li>some used <strong>method_missing</strong>: node.dot.notation</li>
</ul>


<p>I usually refer to this last as &#8220;dot notation,&#8221; mostly because I had no idea what else to call it at first. I still call it that as it&#8217;s an intuitive reference for someone who doesn&#8217;t know much Ruby. I read up on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_object.html#Object.method_missing">method_missing</a> in prep for this blog post, but it was a new term and concept to me.</p>

<h4>O dot notation, how do I love thee?</h4>

<p>Getting back to it, I <em>lurved</em> my dot notation. It was easy to type. It was easy to read. It was harder to make typos. I am the queen of typos. Anything that helps me make fewer is my favorite friend. Then Chef Summit happened and recaps happened and I was like:</p>

<p><img src="images/yutakeawaymaidots.jpg" float: left /></p>

<p>At first I was outraged that they were <em>oppressing</em> my dot notation and I was terrified they would deprecate it, which would make me sad. For a long time after that, I was just mad and still loved my dot notation and resolved to just keep using it anyway. This was the first time I had the urge to blog about it. I was planning to tell everyone to piss off. I loved my dot notation and I didn&#8217;t want it taken away.</p>

<p><img src="images/nocanheerz.jpg" float: right /></p>

<p>I mean, yeah, dot notation didn&#8217;t always work and I probably never understood why. I was like this when I first learned chef:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was having a conversation about consulting and how important it is to
not be emotionally attached to your solutions. As a consultant, you exist to be
an enabler. You help others succeed with tasks that, without your expertise, they
might fail instead.  As consultants, our value comes from a long history of
observing and participating in spectacular failures and fantastic
successes. We know what works and what doesn&#8217;t work and we can articulate the
reasons why.  But our value can be compromised if we can&#8217;t interact effectively
with our clients. This means checking your emotions and inner schadenfreude at
the door and working with clients to discover a solution that is practical for
their environment.</p>

<h5>BOFH</h5>

<p>Back in the day, I worked on a silo&#8217;d web operations team at a big retail
company. We knew how we liked things done and, although we might argue amongst
ourselves, we presented a united bullying front to the dev teams.  For example,
  we didn&#8217;t allow them to deploy apps into production when they came with the
  caveat of &#8220;you have to restart the app every night.&#8221; We drank developer tears
  with breakfast, and we liked it that way.</p>

<p>  Guess what? Consultants don&#8217;t have that luxury. I might also argue that
  internal operations teams no longer have that luxury, but that&#8217;s a blog for
  another day.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is partially a post for posterity because I can never remember the format of this when I want it and I have to search all over the Internets for it.&nbsp; And for some reason, it&#8217;s really hard to find with keywords.&nbsp; Possibly my google-fu sucks, but I actually think it&#8217;s a java developer conspiracy.</p>
<p>The first time I found this jvm arg, it was by accident.&nbsp; I was reading a page of comprehensive JVM args.&nbsp; No it wasn&#8217;t for fun, although I was enjoying it.&nbsp; I was on a gig to help a client get rid of 20 second garbage collections that were crashing their site.&nbsp; So I was reading through the page just to see what might be useful and I found this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>-XX:MaxJavaStackTraceDepth=&lt;num&gt;</strong></span></p>
<p>It was love at first sight.&nbsp; See, I know developers lurve their stack traces and exceptions.&nbsp; Truly.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve met some truly horrendous apps.&nbsp; You know the kind.&nbsp; They throw 500 line stack traces every time someone types in a bad password. Or you have an overrun team that, once an app is in production, they don&#8217;t have time to tune the app and so you are stuck with 2000 lines of stack trace for every exception, even though it only takes &lt; 10 to figure out where to look for trouble.</p>
<p>After I found this and used it, I had bookmarked the page of wonderful jvm options, but it was dead the next time I went there. So I ended up searching the internet for it later and found that my googling led me all over.&nbsp; I found a stackoverflow discussion where a harried admin was asking about it and a herd of VERY ANGRY developers jumped all over him saying things like</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you truncate our wonderful stack traces!&#8221;, and</p>
<p>&#8220;An exception is called that because it&#8217;s <em>exceptional</em>. There&#8217;s a reason for it and you shouldn&#8217;t truncate it!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh they were like an angry mob.</p>
<p>But I have to tell you, this arg is an admin&#8217;s best friend if you have apps in your care that can&#8217;t be bothered with proper tuning on the dev side.&nbsp; Often this was because a client had a contract dev team come in, deliver an app and then leave.&nbsp; There was no one to fix it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shame in cleaning up your log files so they are readable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s tough to actually dig into a problem if you have thousands of lines of &#8220;benign&#8221; errors filling your world.&nbsp; This option allows you to limit the damage done by excessive logging while still seeing that an exception is being generated. Of course, with all the wonderful logging packages and tools with filters out there today, this sort of thing is less important if you are filtering, but there are lots of admins out there with nothing but the CLI, syslog and vi even today. This post is dedicated to them.</p>
