<p>This is a small shop at corner of William and Platt in the Financial
District.  The coffee is too hot leading me to guess they overcook the milk. I ate
half a bagel waiting for it to cool off. If I had been walking, I would have
wanted a sleeve, which I generally never need with artisan coffee joints. It
was interesting that the beans were Intelligentsia as the taste seemed to
have a lot more licorice or citrus than the other locations serving the same
beans. Reminded me a bit of Stumptown when it's pulled too long.</p>

<p>Other, non-coffee specific: It's hot in here. It's a very small space and
I think there's some a/c near the counter, but I'm about 8 feet away at
a window bar and sweating while drinking my coffee. Also, despite ordering
"for here," I received cups with lids on them and a bagel toasted but wrapped
up in wax paper and a lunch bag.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: They're 2 blocks from where I'm staying and bagel noms.<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: scalded milk, bitter, citric taste, location heat.</p>

<p>Followup: It was 90 degrees Friday afternoon, so I opted to walk back here
despite the meh experience of the morning.  I got the same kind of drink that
I think had even more milk than my morning cups. Very disappointing
experience for a shop that actually has a La Marzocco in residence.</p>

<p>Final word: Despite the La Marzocco, this shop is not serving artisan coffee
and I don't recommend it. It beats Starbucks, but just barely. Intelligentsia
should investigate the crimes being committed against their beans in this location.</p>

<strong>Location:</strong> New York, Tribeca a few blocks from the GZ Memorial<br/>

 This coffee shop was recommended to me by a casual Facebook friend who moved to NYC
 from Minneapolis and used to be a barista himself.</p>

<p> Kaffe 1668 is a lovely little shop with dark wood tables and benches. It's
 quite dim inside and I really like it. They serve espresso drinks and
 individually brewed coffee.  My cappuccinos were low temperature and actually
 cooled rather quickly as I was lollygagging.  However, they were very good and
 I enjoyed every drop. In a world where too many drinks are made with scalded
 milk, I'm ok with the consequences of low temps. The shop has cold pastries.
 I had a scone on my first visit and a breakfast sandwich on a baguette on the
 next. The scone was good, the baguette was chewy(I know nothing about french
breads so take that fwiw).</p>

<p> Your wait for coffee can be significant. The line moved a bit slow and it
 took a while for my drinks to be made.  However, it's worth it as the
 baristas are perfectionists and won't serve a substandard drink. On my first
 visit I was informed that my second cup was late because they were remaking
 it.   I understand they recalibrate espresso pulls throughout the day here
 which is awesome.</p>

<p> One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to be a stroller destination on
 Saturday mornings. It's still worth it for good coffee which seems to be
 missing in most of Downtown, but cranky babies can be a bit tough on the ears
 in the early morning.</p>

<p> Bonus: They're open on Labor Day. Guess where I'm going when I get up
 tomorrow?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm embarking on something I've wanted to do for a long time. Coffee reviews
for traveling nerds. I don't travel extensively but I do go places and my trip
logistics are often driven by my need for acceptable espresso drinks. Over the
years I've raised the bar several times for what I want in a coffee shop. I used to just get excited that
I could find Starbucks on road trips through Nebraska and Oklahoma or had
a Starbucks across the street from my hotel.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These days I look a little harder for local shops serving artisan espresso
drinks. I have been know to pore over Google Maps and search the internet for
hours before choosing a hotel for a trip. For road trips I look ahead of time
at where we might be able to stop for coffee, mostly because I'm afraid we'll
miss the only coffee shop within 300 miles (this can happen in Texas!).</p>

<p>I'm not a top of the line coffee snob. I don't attend cuppings and I'm not sure
I could tell the diff between espresso shots. To be honest, I'm not too fond of
straight espresso. I prefer my drinks to be about cappuccino strength. I don't
roast my own beans although I've met those who have. I can't make very good
coffee art, although I enjoy trying.</p>

<p>I drink most of my espresso at home, which is part of what's raised the
bar when I look for coffee shops. If you spend a lot of time pursuing a great
shot, you start noticing when you're served bitter espresso or scalded milk. I went from religiously drinking
Caribou cappuccinos to actively loathing them over a period of a few years.</p>

<p>Many years ago I had a Krups pot boiler espresso machine and a blade grinder.
I used that for years and considered it fine. Then I started thinking I wanted
a nicer espresso maker and started reading.  That's when I learned about
grinders. Instead of buying a new espresso machine, I ended up buying a <a href="http://www.mazzer.com/scheda.asp?idprod=2">Mazzer
Mini</a>. This was before the Euro and when things were less expensive. I believe
it cost me around $350 at the time. That was all the money I could afford to
spend for a long time, so I had a super nice grinder and a crappy pot boiler
espresso machine.</p>

<p>Eventually my boyfriend and I each got Starbucks Barista machines on sale for
$200 and they were great for their price point until they died. At that point,
I was making more money and decided I wanted something nicer. I opted for
a <a href="http://www.rancilio.it/rancilio/prod_model.jsp?id_model=49&amp;id_language=3&amp;id_category=26">Rancilio Silivia</a>
which I later modded with a <a href="http://www.pidsilvia.com/">PID</a> that allows you to see and
regulate the brewing temperature for espresso.  This is where I'm at today:
Mazzer Mini, Rancilio Sivia. I tend to use the same espresso beans as
calibrating the grinder for different kinds requires wasting about half a pound
and too much time.  So I stick with a local provider: <a href="http://www.peacecoffee.com/">Peace Coffee
espresso beans</a>.
What do I consider an artisan shop? There are several optional
components but a few obvious things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Their espresso machine aren't automatic</strong>:
If you push a button to make the espresso, chances are good it's going to taste
like ass, no matter how beautifully the beans were roasted. Example: I ended up
at a Pete's Coffee in Santa Clara and was surprised at how downright yummy my
latte tasted. This shop was using a La Marzocco. I was so pleased that when
I went to the airport, I ordered some there.  The same drink came out of an
automated machine and was so vile I threw it out.  Seriously.  So this one
isn't negotiable. You can't have an automatic and call yourself artisan. Please
point me in the direction of anyone making sublime drinks with an automatic if
you disagree.</li>
<li><strong>Beans are ground for each drink, not hours in advance</strong>:
Yes this really happens. I have stopped at a few places and had them make
espresso with grounds from a bin.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee Art</strong>:
I consider this mandatory although not necessarily every single time if I go
often. What this tells a first time visitor though is that your baristas have
been trained on more than how to look at a theromometer and push a button. It
also adds a nice finishing touch to the drink, communicating that each drink is
an individual effort.</li>
</ul>


<p>Less mandatory, I like it when the barista can talk about calibration and taste
notes with their espresso(s). Another thing you'll find in serious artisan
shops is milk snobbery.  When the Angry Catfish opened in Minneapolis, they did
several taste tests before settling on a local milk provider. They also only
serve whole milk, no arguments, although they'll also use soy.</p>

<p>So anyway, I've started writing up my NYC coffee shop experiences and will post
a separate snippet for each shop. I'll also create entries for places like that
awesome shop we found in Denton, TX and other recent trips to Baltimore,
Seattle and Santa Clara. I know this is
a technical blog, but coffee is so much a part of our lifestyles that it seems
a natural add-on. I hope you enjoy it and if you have suggestions for places
for me to visit, please let me know.</p>
