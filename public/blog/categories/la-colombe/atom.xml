    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lacolombe.com">La Colombe</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, NoHo@400 Lafayette<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: La Colombe<br/>
<strong>Machines</strong>: La Marzocco &amp; Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: yes<br/>
<strong>Wifi</strong>: unknown<br/>
<strong>Served in</strong>: 8oz ceramic <br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cap<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 9/2/12</p>

<p>This was a quick stop while out shopping with a friend. There's ample seating
and it's a light, airy space. My coffee was ok, although it was a smidge
bitter. I'd probably have to try again to see how I liked the coffee.
However, it's a great place, good for meeting a friend or stopping in and
they take their coffee production pretty seriously. I didn't actually see
a menu anywhere although I wasn't looking.</p>

<p>They did have an adorable water "fountain" that offered room temperature,
cold or carbonated water and they'll offer you a water cup no problem.  The
staff is professional and fast. This coffee shop had the most starbucksian
feel to it of all the shops I've been too, but I don't really mean that in
a derogatory way. I just mean that they turned out product quickly. The
product they turned out was definitely far superior to anything Starbucks
will serve you. I still prefer low-lit, shabby, hipster joints, but I'd have
no problem coming back here.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast, good coffee<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: None really</p>
