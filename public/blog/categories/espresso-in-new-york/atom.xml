    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lacolombe.com">La Colombe</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, NoHo@400 Lafayette<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: La Colombe<br/>
<strong>Machines</strong>: La Marzocco &amp; Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: yes<br/>
<strong>Wifi</strong>: unknown<br/>
<strong>Served in</strong>: 8oz ceramic <br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cap<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 9/2/12</p>

<p>This was a quick stop while out shopping with a friend. There's ample seating
and it's a light, airy space. My coffee was ok, although it was a smidge
bitter. I'd probably have to try again to see how I liked the coffee.
However, it's a great place, good for meeting a friend or stopping in and
they take their coffee production pretty seriously. I didn't actually see
a menu anywhere although I wasn't looking.</p>

<p>They did have an adorable water "fountain" that offered room temperature,
cold or carbonated water and they'll offer you a water cup no problem.  The
staff is professional and fast. This coffee shop had the most starbucksian
feel to it of all the shops I've been too, but I don't really mean that in
a derogatory way. I just mean that they turned out product quickly. The
product they turned out was definitely far superior to anything Starbucks
will serve you. I still prefer low-lit, shabby, hipster joints, but I'd have
no problem coming back here.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast, good coffee<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: None really</p>

<strong>Location</strong>: near Times Square<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Macchiatto 44 roasted by Seattle-based Fonte Micro Roasters<br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: Fonte branded<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>

<p>Sorry, no picture. This was on the run with friends.</p>

<p>Macchiato is a local two-shop chain in NY. It's a restaurant as well as coffee
bar and appears to have a brisk lunch crowd. Seating is small tables and
chairs. This was a spontaneous stop after having lunch with friends near Times
Square. We stood in a long but efficient line. I was alarmed at the amount of
milk they poured in my 12oz drink and thought it would taste more like milk
than coffee.  While I would have preferred less milk, the taste was still
sweet, I could still taste coffee and the micro foam was lovely.  The
temperature of the drink was fine without a sleeve and the taste was nicely
sweet, leading me to suspect they probably use local and/or premium milk.
I prefer my caps with less milk, but if you aren't picky about lattes vs caps,
you'll probably like it. If I'd actually ordered a macchiato, it probably would
have been lovely.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast service, lovely taste, great micro foam<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Busy and lacking in attention to detail.</p>

<p>Final word: I would go here if I were near but wouldn't go out of my way to get
some and I might look around for something different if I were planning ahead.
I think 12oz cups are way too big for most drinks, but it did taste good, so
YMMV.  It makes me interested in checking out Fonte Coffee Roasters in Seattle!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bluespooncoffee.com/">Blue Spoon</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Downtown (Williams and Platt)<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Intelligentsia<br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: La Marzocco + Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: yes, from the park across the street (NY DTA), sketchy<br/>

<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>

<p>This is a small shop at corner of William and Platt in the Financial
District.  The coffee is too hot leading me to guess they overcook the milk. I ate
half a bagel waiting for it to cool off. If I had been walking, I would have
wanted a sleeve, which I generally never need with artisan coffee joints. It
was interesting that the beans were Intelligentsia as the taste seemed to
have a lot more licorice or citrus than the other locations serving the same
beans. Reminded me a bit of Stumptown when it's pulled too long.</p>

<p>Other, non-coffee specific: It's hot in here. It's a very small space and
I think there's some a/c near the counter, but I'm about 8 feet away at
a window bar and sweating while drinking my coffee. Also, despite ordering
"for here," I received cups with lids on them and a bagel toasted but wrapped
up in wax paper and a lunch bag.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: They're 2 blocks from where I'm staying and bagel noms.<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: scalded milk, bitter, citric taste, location heat.</p>

<p>Followup: It was 90 degrees Friday afternoon, so I opted to walk back here
despite the meh experience of the morning.  I got the same kind of drink that
I think had even more milk than my morning cups. Very disappointing
experience for a shop that actually has a La Marzocco in residence.</p>

<p>Final word: Despite the La Marzocco, this shop is not serving artisan coffee
and I don't recommend it. It beats Starbucks, but just barely. Intelligentsia
should investigate the crimes being committed against their beans in this location.</p>

<strong>Location:</strong> New York, Tribeca a few blocks from the GZ Memorial<br/>
<strong>Espresso:</strong> Intelligentsia <br/>
<strong>Hardware:</strong> Synesso &amp; Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art:</strong> Yes<br/>

 This coffee shop was recommended to me by a casual Facebook friend who moved to NYC
 from Minneapolis and used to be a barista himself.</p>

<p> Kaffe 1668 is a lovely little shop with dark wood tables and benches. It's
 quite dim inside and I really like it. They serve espresso drinks and
 individually brewed coffee.  My cappuccinos were low temperature and actually
 cooled rather quickly as I was lollygagging.  However, they were very good and
 I enjoyed every drop. In a world where too many drinks are made with scalded
 milk, I'm ok with the consequences of low temps. The shop has cold pastries.
 I had a scone on my first visit and a breakfast sandwich on a baguette on the
 next. The scone was good, the baguette was chewy(I know nothing about french
breads so take that fwiw).</p>

<p> Your wait for coffee can be significant. The line moved a bit slow and it
 took a while for my drinks to be made.  However, it's worth it as the
 baristas are perfectionists and won't serve a substandard drink. On my first
 visit I was informed that my second cup was late because they were remaking
 it.   I understand they recalibrate espresso pulls throughout the day here
 which is awesome.</p>

<p> One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to be a stroller destination on
 Saturday mornings. It's still worth it for good coffee which seems to be
 missing in most of Downtown, but cranky babies can be a bit tough on the ears
 in the early morning.</p>

<p> Bonus: They're open on Labor Day. Guess where I'm going when I get up
 tomorrow?</p>
