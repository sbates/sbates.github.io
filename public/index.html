  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night we had a fun second meetup of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Infracoders">Twin Cities Infracoders group</a>.  On the docket were presentations and demos for Vagrant and Sensu.  We had about 18 people show up and a lively discussion ensued on why you&#8217;d want to use something like Vagrant and implementation strategies.</p>

<p>Most of us have partnered with development teams who have asked for things that are difficult to provide or unwise and one of the best use cases for Vagrant is the ability to hand someone a development environment homogenous to the team and easy to troubleshoot. It&#8217;s homogenous because everyone uses the same base OS box file and also uses the same provisioner to create the environment, whether that&#8217;s Chef, Puppet or Bash scripts or anything else. It also shortens time required to bootstrap a new team member.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mpgoetz">Mike Goetz</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasduffield">Tom Duffield</a> gave us a great compressed Wordpress install demo on a local VM with Vagrant and Chef. Then they gave us a second demo of spinning up two ec2 instances to separate the front and back end pieces of Wordpress.</p>

<p>After Vagrant, we ran through some Sensu slides and looked at some basic info about Sensu.  There were technical difficulties around the demos we were working on so demoing was minimal but discussion around why Sensu, how Sensu and when you might switch was great and we&#8217;re looking forward to a more detailed demo at next month&#8217;s meetup.</p>

<h5>Here is the collection of tools and links from last night:</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a><br/>
<a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/index.html">Vagrant Plugins</a><br/>
<a href="http://sensuapp.org/">Sensu</a><br/>
<a href="http://slides.sensuapp.org/">Sean Porter&#8217;s Slides</a><br/>
Wordpress Demo(this link will be available shortly)</p>

<h5>Coming up:</h5>

<p>Next month&#8217;s meetup, hosted again at the Nerdery, will be a presentation on using Selenium for automated testing and QA as well as our enhanced Sensu Server and client nodes deployed with Vagabond on LXCs inside a Vagrant VM.  I hope we get a great turnout.</p>

<p>On another note, I have been talking lately about how I want to organize a Chef hackday. After last night&#8217;s discussions around tooling and workflow, I think it might be nice to instead do a tool-agnostic Workflow Tooling hack and help day. Many of us have gotten workflows configured successfully, but depending on your experience beating on the Ruby toolchain, it can be challenging the first couple times you do it.  The Nerdery said they would probably be willing to host and I was thinking about asking CoCo Minneapolis if they had any interest in hosting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post up a question in the meetup group about location and date preferences to see if I get enough interest to make it a thing. I&#8217;ll also send someone to shill at the monthly DevOps meetup that I can never attend due to my work travel schedule.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t made it out to an Infracoder meetup yet, I hope you because we are having some great tech discussions and getting to hear about other people&#8217;s uses cases for things is fascinating. Also, the Nerdery takes super great care of us and feeds us Pizza for dinner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had an <a href="https://twitter.com/sascha_d/status/319889574367215616">interesting exchange</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk">Adam Jacob</a> yesterday on Twitter around devops consulting. It&#8217;s a topic I&#8217;ve discussed often with friends as we work out how to spread the devops message in our consulting adventures.  After the Twitter chat, I&#8217;m motivated to say a few words about devops consulting, not because there was an argument, but because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve thought about often since I started independent consulting and I think it&#8217;s important.</p>

<p> The twitterings began with me trolling Adam on a topic about which I learned my first, best lessons from him.  Two years ago, my ideas around devops were still mostly unformed when I saw him give his <em>&#8220;What is Devops&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;The No Assholes Rule&#8221;</em> vignettes at Velocity. These two 5 minute segments clarified several nebulous thoughts I&#8217;d been having and form the base for how I approach devops today.</p>

<p>My trolling quickly transformed into an exchange as to whether devops consulting is a valid thing.  Here&#8217;s my take:</p>

<h4>Devops is The New Black</h4>

<p>As far as toolmakers, tool-consumers and recruiters are all concerned, devops is the new black. I get frustrated with the &#8220;slap a devops on it and they will come&#8221; attitude we see prevailing. It makes me want to never use the word <em>&#8220;devops&#8221;</em> to describe anything ever because of things like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If it&#8217;s a tool for scaling or automation or monitoring or cloud, it&#8217;s now a &#8220;devops tool&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a job for some poor schlub to do production support for the dev team, you call it &#8220;looking for a devops engineer with build experience.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>A tooling company has a giant virtual sticker on the website: &#8220;Designed by devops.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to get some other poor schlub to join your overworked ops team you call it a &#8220;devops engineering&#8221; position but it&#8217;s really just another day in the life of duct-taping together prod.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I already hear colleagues succumbing to the terminology &#8220;devops Tool&#8221; because it&#8217;s a phrase understood by (or at least familiar to) upper management and business users. I can even see the day when I give in and start calling things devops tools. This makes me sad.</p>

<h4>Emo Devops</h4>

<p> Call me cynical, but this sort of devaluation discourages me and has turned me into something of a hipster goth. You know, the girl in all black with the black nail polish listening to Bauhaus and denying she&#8217;s goth because she transcends labels in her non-originality. I can make fun of this girl because I was her in high school.</p>

<p> But as I see tool companies and recruiters slapping devops across everything and large companies begging for the devops panacea, I become less and less inclined to talk about devops and the hipster goth in me is damned if she&#8217;s going to cash in on all the quick bucks of devops consulting.</p>

<h4>Devops Consulting - Why I Don&#8217;t</h4>

<p>Last year I had a company try to hire me as a devops consultant, but the very idea made me shudder. It felt utterly pretentious even though they had the best of intentions and were knowledgeable about devops.  My business card says Devops Enthusiast. That&#8217;s it. I love it and I try to live it every day I walk into an office, whether it&#8217;s my home office, a client office or any other place with people in it.</p>

<p>But my business card will never say Devops Consultant. Why not?</p>

<p><em>Devops Isn&#8217;t a Deliverable</em> - When I get done with you, you don&#8217;t have a devops. It&#8217;s possible that the things we&#8217;re working on will bring you closer to a lifestyle and culture that is devops. And that&#8217;s super.  Working at scale demands extraordinary feats of technical prowess, but it also demands empathy and trust, key components of devops culture. I expect this to be a natural byproduct of my tenure, not the thing I craft.</p>

<p><em>Consultants Have No Moral Authority</em> - This is the classic water and horse thing. You can hire someone to tell you how to do devops, but unless everyone is signed on and excited, it&#8217;s going to be the consultant and the person who hired the consultant drinking from the trough and a bunch of other horses standing around dehydrating.  I have no desire to earn a living doing this.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;m Not Qualified</em> - I learn new things every day and I often remind myself that devops isn&#8217;t just me preaching DevOplyness, but also involves me actively empathizing with and trusting people I find difficult or frustrating to work with.  This stuff is hard, and I&#8217;m not even close to perfect. I&#8217;d rather lead by example than preach. I feel like a hypocrite telling other people how to put their house in order when I&#8217;m still cleaning my own.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;d Rather Be Crafting</em> - Let&#8217;s face it. If I say Devops Consultant, that&#8217;s management consulting. As much as I&#8217;ve considered going into management because of the ignorance I see in charge of stuff, <strong>I&#8217;d rather be making things</strong>. This is a selfish thing, right? I love to CLI and hack on Ruby and play with Chef and figure out why stuff is broken, mentor newer engineers and coach devs on how to operationalize their apps. I don&#8217;t get to do that if I&#8217;m teaching senior management about devops. It&#8217;s why I like consulting. There&#8217;s always a new problem to solve.</p>

<h4>Is Continuous Delivery a valid Euphemism for devops?</h4>

<p>This was also touched on yesterday. Jeff Sussna wrote a <a href="http://blog.ingineering.it/post/43356457789/devops-er-continuous-delivery">well-articulated article</a> for why we should just call it Continuous Delivery instead of devops.  I think Adam and I were not actually disagreeing about anything in our chat today, unless he was postulating that CD is as nebulous as devops. I don&#8217;t think it is. I think Continuous Delivery is a measurable deliverable and a valid consulting field. If done right, it results in not just a great pipeline, but also devops culture because CD should be impossible with crappy culture.</p>

<h4>What About devops?</h4>

<p>I know some folks who are doing the devops consulting thing. They generally <em>want</em> to do the management consulting thing and they believe wholeheartedly in devops as cultural shift and in
<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">CAMS</a>, which I think is the key to making it work, if that&#8217;s what you really want to do.<br/>
There are also some super fantastic companies with amazing cultures; some calling it devops, others not but still living the lifestyle. I&#8217;m not panning everything calling itself devops. However, the more I see vendors and recruiters latch onto the word and commoditize it without sincerity, the less I want to actually associate with the word myself and the more grains of salt I require when I get yet another email from someone telling me about their great devops job for which I&#8217;d be a perfect fit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.chromaticcoffee.com">Chromatic Coffee</a>   <br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: Santa Clara, CA, a few miles from the Apple campus  <br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: <a href="http://www.chromaticcoffee.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=emperor%2Despresso">Emperor</a> <br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: La Marzocco and heavily modded grinders of unknown origin (see picture) <br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: heck yeah <br/>
<strong>Wifi</strong>: Yes <br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: Cappuccino <br/>
<strong>Served in</strong>: 5oz ceramic cups <br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: Daily in February and March 2013</p>

<p><img src="/images/chromatic_coffee.jpg"></p>

<p>I first met Chromatic Coffee when it was a franchise under another name in June 2012. For the record, it was super then too. I recently acquired a client in Santa Clara, CA and knew I would be traveling out here every week.  Strangely, Silicon Valley does NOT have a great artisan coffee shop on every corner. A lot of the area is actually office park and strip mall hell.  When I found this place last year, I drove 8 miles from the Hyatt Convention Hotel to get some decent coffee. (For the other record, all of the espresso served at the Hyatt is utterly vile).</p>

<p>So I immediately thought of this location when I set up weekly trips to California. In the meantime I discovered the shop had changed its name to Chromatic Coffee but was the same crew of awesome baristas that I&#8217;d met last year.  I actually managed to find a good hotel near the shop, putting me about 5 miles from the client but worth every commuting minute, knowing I&#8217;d have decent coffee at least once a day (I work in office park hell).</p>

<p>I am happy to say that breaking off on their own has only improved things over here.  In my chats with the baristas, I&#8217;ve learned that the owner is a tech obsessed uber coffee nerd. You can see this in the fact that they are their own roastery and hey, check out the grinders.  Heavily modded, the barista couldn&#8217;t remember the original brand on them, but informed me that the owner is actually working on his own equipment as well. (uber techie coffee nerds unite!).</p>

<p><img src="/images/chromatic_grinders.jpg"></p>

<p>So I can&#8217;t tell you enough how much I love Chromatic. Everyone there is super nice and super knowledgeable about the coffee and will happily nerd out over coffee talk when it&#8217;s not busy.  There&#8217;s also a Hario pourover bar and they tell me they make cold brew as well, which I will be sampling next week.  In addition to all the other awesome, they hold classes on everything from pour-over technique to barista art.</p>

<p>Bonus: They are not snooty coffee snobs here. You can order your drink with skim milk or to go and no one will look down their nose at your or inform you snottily that they only use whole milk from locally approved cows.</p>

<p>I wish I could keep gushing, but you should really get in here and try them for yourself. Don&#8217;t be fooled by their strip mall exterior. They are beyond awesome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/gremlin3.jpg"/></p>

<p>Today I ended up in a heated discussion with some team mates over deployment strategies. As is often the case with this team, myself included when I don&#8217;t stop and think, we often leap right to arguing over which tool is best before discussing the problem we want to solve. It wasn&#8217;t the first time.</p>

<p>The source of this discussion was brought on while we were reviewing some chef work I&#8217;m doing with a development team.  My work was mainly to assist them in getting to functioning cookbooks that also had their app logic separate from global cookbooks. I basically copied their intent wherever it made sense while shoring up design and Chef styling. One of the things they were doing was making a call to our Artifactory server for a latest snapshot of a WAR file, downloading it into the Tomcat directory and restarting Tomcat. Works for me.</p>

<p>Getting to this point in the review triggered a long, heated debate over</p>

<ol>
<li>whether you ever wanted this to happen,</li>
<li>whether you should use Chef to manage deployments, use Jenkins to kick off shell scripts or use some other orchestration tool to do something else or</li>
<li>just copy the world by hand (well, no one really believes that last is a good idea).</li>
</ol>


<p>I was like, geez guys, I&#8217;m just mimicking the dev team&#8217;s functionality, why are we are arguing about this? But this has been a topic of discussion often recently and, with another team announcing yesterday they were writing a homegrown tool to manage jboss, deploy ATG ears and manage config files all retrieved from Artifactory, I don&#8217;t expect the subject to die soon.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one right answer to how you deploy your code, but I think there are many poorly thought out ones. I&#8217;m not here to necessarily make an argument for Chef as a deployment orchestrator.  While there are people deploying with Chef at scale, I am not one of them, nor have I been. My work with Chef has been mainly in development with some provisioning and so I have a lot of theories, but that&#8217;s really all.  What I do want to talk about is why I don&#8217;t like shell scripts for deployments or orchestration and what I want in a deployment system. This is the first part of at least a 2 on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Shell Scripts are like Gremlins</strong>. You start out with one adorably cute shell script. You commented it and it does one thing really well. It&#8217;s easy to read, everyone can use it. It&#8217;s awesome! Then you accidentally spill some water on it, or feed it late one night and omgwtf is happening!?</p>

<p><strong>The Fixer</strong>: Someone else comes along and found an edge case your shell script doesn&#8217;t deal with. They add in some logic for the edge case, voila, problem solved.</p>

<p><strong>The Refiner</strong>: Eventually someone realizes the logic for the edge case is not specific enough and is causing deployments to fail sometimes, so they refine the logic.</p>

<p><strong> The Slippery Slope</strong>: After that, someone might decide it&#8217;s a good idea to automate stopping the apache server from sending traffic during deployments and decides to do it in the same script.  Great idea! That&#8217;s such an awesome idea that everyone starts adding functionality to the tiny beautiful shell script, now no longer tiny nor beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>OMG GREMLINS!</strong>  Then you come back along and find all the extra stuff in your shell script that doesn&#8217;t belong there.  You&#8217;re horrified. You might even be feeling a little bit violated (come on, we&#8217;ve all been there at least once).  So what do you do? You pour some water on it. You break out the shell script into several functional bits. Now we have LOTS of gremlins instead of just one. Now you have a <em>suite</em> of scripts that are once again beautiful. But now the deployment is complex. You have a suite of <del>bash</del> <del>perl</del> <del>ruby</del> <del>python</del> scripts that also need a wiki page to describe intended flow, what to do if something doesn&#8217;t work and any edge cases that you haven&#8217;t gotten around to scripting yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Exodus</strong>: Next up: You get a call from a buddy who is dying to have you come work for his Next Big Thing startup. So you quit your job, pack your bags and move to Silicon Valley Sitcom with ne&#8217;er a backwards glance, leaving a couple of forlorn junior sysadmins desperately reading wiki pages trying to figure out what to do with your shell scripts as a new application is launched that requires a bunch of new logic for deployment. These guys do the best they can and start tacking on if statements everywhere they need to in order to make the deployments go.</p>

<p><strong>Subsistance Living</strong>: 6 months later, one of these guys leaves and the company hires 3 more guys with no understanding of the history of the deployment scripts.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don&#8217;t, people aren&#8217;t entirely sure why and just self correct by hand at the command line until things work(phew!). Everyone is afraid to touch them because they are fragile, the code connecting them is obscure and there are similar logic blocks found in several sections, sometimes commented out, sometimes used, but you&#8217;re not really sure whether it&#8217;s necessary. The original wiki page gets updated sometimes but not often and not usually by the person maintaining the scripts but by the people using them in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s why I hate shell scripts and think you should never use them for deployment scaffolding.</p>

<p><strong>True story</strong>: my first venture with Chef involved deconstructing an organically grown Kickstart post that had been originally written for Red Hat 3 and subsequently updated for RH 4, 5 and 6.  I was removing functionality from the postscript and rewriting it in Chef blocks when one of the admins came and yelled at me for omitting a block of host names from /etc/hosts and I was like, GUYS, those host names are for servers in a data center that was decommissioned  when I started here 3 years ago.</p>

<p>You can tune in for the second half of this blog post, what I want in a decent deployment system, when it goes up next week on the <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com">Sysadvent blog</a>.  Woohoo!</p>

<p>The Blue Ox coffee shop opened up about 3 blocks from my house in 2011.  I love
them. I love that they opened up in what I consider a marginalized area of
Minneapolis, albeit one that people are working to revitalize. I love that
I can walk 3 blocks to get wonderful artisan coffee. Sadly, I&#8217;m super lazy and
often stay home and make my own substandard not-really-artisan coffee instead.</p>

<p>Blue Ox always has local art on the walls. Furnished with several second hand
dinette tables and chairs, they also have a comfy futon and you&#8217;ll often find
the windows open and the ceiling fans running instead of a/c.</p>

<p>Baristas here are always willing to talk the finer points of espresso and
coffee with you.  They have individually brewed coffee, pour over and they&#8217;ll
make you an AeroPress Aerobie coffee if you ask.  I&#8217;ve chatted with them and
I know they calibrate the espresso grind and length of the pull at least every
morning, sometimes more.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve cycled through a few different brands of coffee and have recently
started serving Counter Culture beans. When paired with the local milk used
here, these produce a lovely, sweet  espresso drink.</p>

<p>Warning, Blue Ox only serves whole milk.  There is no skim or 2% here. They
probably have soy, although I haven&#8217;t asked.  They have locally baked pastries
but no hot food. Today when I came in, they were also offering chips and hummus
or salsa.</p>

<p>When you combine the laid back atmosphere and super yummy coffee combined with
proximity to my house, Blue Ox pretty much wins my &#8220;favorite coffee shop in
Minneapolis&#8221; award.  That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t other places just as good
and I&#8217;ll be getting to those in future posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.irvingfarm.com/index.cfm">Irving Farm Coffee Roasters</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, 14th St &amp; 7th Ave, Uptownish<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Irving Farms<br/>
<strong>Machines</strong>: La Marzocco &amp; Doge<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: yes<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: Unknown<br/>

<strong>Visited</strong>: 9/2/12</p>

<p><img src="/images/irvingfarm.jpg"/></p>

<p>Verdict: Noms. Seems like a lot of places in NYC are serving Intelligentsia
coffee.  While I don&#8217;t object necessarily, it&#8217;s nice to see a coffee shop using
locally roasted or even better, roasting its own.  My drink was mild and
reminded me a bit of Stumptown with it&#8217;s citric tinge. They heated the milk
a bit more than some places but it was still drinkable and I like my milk with
a smidge of heat so the drink doesn&#8217;t cool off too soon. I&#8217;m guessing they heat
to 145-150.</p>

<p>There are four small tables and a wall bench at this location, so the lounge
factor isn&#8217;t high.  However, the was an elderly man enjoying his newspaper
when I got here and so I&#8217;m guessing foot traffic isn&#8217;t too obnoxious.
The shop is small and unassuming from the outside and I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed
except I got off the subway there and was looking for friends.</p>

<p>Fyi, no public bathroom</p>

<p><strong>Final Word</strong>: Noms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://financierpastries.com/">Financier Coffee</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Cedar &amp; William, Downtown, Financial District<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Financier (roasted in Park Slope, Brooklyn)<br/>
<strong>Machine</strong>: La Marzocco &amp; Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: kind of (&#8220;It&#8217;s not working right now&#8221;) <br/>
<strong>Served in</strong>: 8oz ceramic cups after I asked twice for &#8220;here&#8221;<br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 9/2/2012</p>

<p><img src="/images/financiercoffee.jpg"></p>

<p>This drink had the potential to taste good.  Unfortunately the
barista had no concept of micro foam or craftsmanship. The taste is a little harsh but I can see
that it could taste awesome if prepared correctly.</p>

<p>Financier prepares and roasts their own beans and so I may come back again and
check as it has the advantage of being close to where I&#8217;m staying and the
subway stations are totally horked with construction this weekend. (n.b.
I didn&#8217;t. I walked to Kaffe 1668 in search of a sure thing).</p>

<p>The pasty case looks amazing but I won&#8217;t be able to report on that. The store
has long bar seating at the window plus some table in the back. While
I prefer the dark hipster coffee shops, this is still ok.  The music is kind
of pop/r&amp;b dreadful. There&#8217;s no public bathroom either btw.</p>

<p>Also, beware, a small cappuccino is really only one shot. They divide the
shots. When I saw that, I asked for the second. This annoyed me.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: cap tastes good despite mangled prep, bright and airy if you like that,
PASTRIES!<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Inexperienced baristas, Split shots (who are you, Starbucks?), crappy wifi</p>

<p><strong>Final word</strong>: Beats Starbucks and the nearby Blue Spoon</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: As a sysadmin, whenever someone tweets something snarky about sysadmins,
I feel a little put down. As a result, I try to think twice about snarky stuff
I might tweet about devs or other teams. And so, I think sysadmins posting snarky captioned
images about devs and then adding the devops hashtag is mean and
inappropriate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this captioned image circulating all day with the devops hashtag on Twitter. For the
record, I don&#8217;t think this picture is funny. In the right context, it might
be funny. If it were, say, a slide in a deck pointing to how things are or
used to be without devops, I&#8217;d laugh. My issue is seeing tweeted with the devops hashtag
and having it billed as funny.</p>

<p>Now I love me some snark. But I think it&#8217;s too easy to be
snarky and mean on Twitter,  because there isn&#8217;t a lot of consequence and we
tend to live within a circle of our peers who often think alike.  The snark
factor often goes up around conference time when many of us are congregating
in once place and competing to sound smart and funny in 140 characters or
less. I&#8217;ve commented before that I think people are too often mean on Twitter
in the name of being witty or complaining about speakers without ever
thinking about what that speaker might feel if he sees that tweet later.</p>

<p>So why does this caption bother me? I have a long history of unfiltered snark
and smart ass remarks. Consulting since 2006 taught me a lot about active
filtering and my introduction to DevOps caused me to implement additional filtering for the
sake of my emotional attachment to an ideal.</p>

<p>As someone who&#8217;s signed on as a big fan of DevOps culture, I spend a lot of
patrolling my cynicism and preventing disparaging remarks from escaping the
filter. I think when you espouse certain ideals, you&#8217;re responsible all the
time for representing them.</p>

<p>I sometimes see cynical, catty remarks about sysadmins or ops from people who
can only have come from a long life of development and, even though I haven&#8217;t
technically done ops in 7 years, I&#8217;ve been sysadminly all my long life and
I am affronted every time by those remarks. Recently I heard a professional dev
say to someone in a beginners programming workshop, &#8220;If you want
to understand/master the install of the programming tools, you&#8217;re probably
better off as a sysadmin not a programmer.&#8221; The guy who said is a super nice
guy, but that remark still got a side-eye from me.</p>

<p>If DevOps is a movement that promotes collaboration, communication, respect
and friendship between functional teams, I don&#8217;t think a sincere proponent
would post this kind of caption. While it makes some folks feel validated,
it&#8217;s just fueling the fire that walls people off from each other.  I don&#8217;t
think we can all get along when folks are throwing up cynical remarks
perpetuating stereotypes of bad development practices.</p>

<p>While there are many successful DevOps teams out there, there are far more
silos in transition or bitter adversaries who haven&#8217;t yet heard of DevOps.
I can&#8217;t believe that only some developers or sysadmins are capable of transcending the usual barriers;
I have to believe that any and all are able to transcend them or what&#8217;s the
point?   But it&#8217;s the more entrenched and cynical cases that will be the most
difficult to move ideologically and emotionally and I feel that humor like
this can only alienate.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to pick on anyone specifically because I see this kind of humor
from all disciplines all the time and it makes me increasingly uncomfortable each
time. If we&#8217;re actually going to all be in this together, we need to jump in
with both feet. So I thought I would speak up for a moment and say something.
If a thing can only be funny by being rude about someone else, maybe it&#8217;s not
actually funny at all.</p>

<p>Sorry, no picture. This was on the run with friends.</p>

<p>Macchiato is a local two-shop chain in NY. It&#8217;s a restaurant as well as coffee
bar and appears to have a brisk lunch crowd. Seating is small tables and
chairs. This was a spontaneous stop after having lunch with friends near Times
Square. We stood in a long but efficient line. I was alarmed at the amount of
milk they poured in my 12oz drink and thought it would taste more like milk
than coffee.  While I would have preferred less milk, the taste was still
sweet, I could still taste coffee and the micro foam was lovely.  The
temperature of the drink was fine without a sleeve and the taste was nicely
sweet, leading me to suspect they probably use local and/or premium milk.
I prefer my caps with less milk, but if you aren&#8217;t picky about lattes vs caps,
you&#8217;ll probably like it. If I&#8217;d actually ordered a macchiato, it probably would
have been lovely.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast service, lovely taste, great micro foam<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Busy and lacking in attention to detail.</p>

<p>Final word: I would go here if I were near but wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to get
some and I might look around for something different if I were planning ahead.
I think 12oz cups are way too big for most drinks, but it did taste good, so
YMMV.  It makes me interested in checking out Fonte Coffee Roasters in Seattle!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bluespooncoffee.com/">Blue Spoon</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Downtown (Williams and Platt)<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Intelligentsia<br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: La Marzocco + Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: yes, from the park across the street (NY DTA), sketchy<br/>
<strong>Served In</strong>: 8oz cardboard<br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 8/31/2012</p>

<p><img src="/images/bluespoon.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a small shop at corner of William and Platt in the Financial
District.  The coffee is too hot leading me to guess they overcook the milk. I ate
half a bagel waiting for it to cool off. If I had been walking, I would have
wanted a sleeve, which I generally never need with artisan coffee joints. It
was interesting that the beans were Intelligentsia as the taste seemed to
have a lot more licorice or citrus than the other locations serving the same
beans. Reminded me a bit of Stumptown when it&#8217;s pulled too long.</p>

<p>Other, non-coffee specific: It&#8217;s hot in here. It&#8217;s a very small space and
I think there&#8217;s some a/c near the counter, but I&#8217;m about 8 feet away at
a window bar and sweating while drinking my coffee. Also, despite ordering
&#8220;for here,&#8221; I received cups with lids on them and a bagel toasted but wrapped
up in wax paper and a lunch bag.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: They&#8217;re 2 blocks from where I&#8217;m staying and bagel noms.<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: scalded milk, bitter, citric taste, location heat.</p>

<p>Followup: It was 90 degrees Friday afternoon, so I opted to walk back here
despite the meh experience of the morning.  I got the same kind of drink that
I think had even more milk than my morning cups. Very disappointing
experience for a shop that actually has a La Marzocco in residence.</p>

<p>Final word: Despite the La Marzocco, this shop is not serving artisan coffee
and I don&#8217;t recommend it. It beats Starbucks, but just barely. Intelligentsia
should investigate the crimes being committed against their beans in this location.</p>
