 This coffee shop was recommended to me by a casual Facebook friend who moved to NYC
 from Minneapolis and used to be a barista himself.</p>

<p> Kaffe 1668 is a lovely little shop with dark wood tables and benches. It&#8217;s
 quite dim inside and I really like it. They serve espresso drinks and
 individually brewed coffee.  My cappuccinos were low temperature and actually
 cooled rather quickly as I was lollygagging.  However, they were very good and
 I enjoyed every drop. In a world where too many drinks are made with scalded
 milk, I&#8217;m ok with the consequences of low temps. The shop has cold pastries.
 I had a scone on my first visit and a breakfast sandwich on a baguette on the
 next. The scone was good, the baguette was chewy(I know nothing about french
breads so take that fwiw).</p>

<p> Your wait for coffee can be significant. The line moved a bit slow and it
 took a while for my drinks to be made.  However, it&#8217;s worth it as the
 baristas are perfectionists and won&#8217;t serve a substandard drink. On my first
 visit I was informed that my second cup was late because they were remaking
 it.   I understand they recalibrate espresso pulls throughout the day here
 which is awesome.</p>

<p> One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to be a stroller destination on
 Saturday mornings. It&#8217;s still worth it for good coffee which seems to be
 missing in most of Downtown, but cranky babies can be a bit tough on the ears
 in the early morning.</p>

<p> Bonus: They&#8217;re open on Labor Day. Guess where I&#8217;m going when I get up
 tomorrow?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m embarking on something I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a long time. Coffee reviews
for traveling nerds. I don&#8217;t travel extensively but I do go places and my trip
logistics are often driven by my need for acceptable espresso drinks. Over the
years I&#8217;ve raised the bar several times for what I want in a coffee shop. I used to just get excited that
I could find Starbucks on road trips through Nebraska and Oklahoma or had
a Starbucks across the street from my hotel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just want to take a moment to point you at an epic new Chef cookbook undertaking. John Larsen has been working on a <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/atg">cookbook to configure a full ATG stack with JBoss</a> and has finished a first version. This is something I always wanted to work on but never got around to, and so I&#8217;m being extra appreciative of someone who did take the time to get it working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has been percolating in my brain for a long time. I mean like, long. Ever since I <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style-Guide+Outline">read a snippet</a> from last year&#8217;s Chef Summit discussing best practices regarding attributes, I&#8217;ve wanted to write something. But what I&#8217;ve got to say keeps changing.</p>

<p>This post assumes some basic familiarity with Chef and node attributes. I assume that most people are going to be bored with the subject matter unless you care about nerdy details or why strings are the official preferred notation. You can get the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Attributes#CookbookAttributes-Notation">short version</a> on the Chef Wiki Cookbook Attributes page. I have a longer discussion here that focuses on my discovery process and evolution of thought.</p>

<h4>A Quick Attribute Notation Overview</h4>

<p>When I first started working with Chef, the publicly available cookbooks and wiki documentation were written in different styles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some used <strong>symbols</strong>: node[:some][:symbol]</li>
<li>some used <strong>strings</strong>: node[&#8216;some&#8217;][&#8216;string&#8217;]</li>
<li>some used <strong>method_missing</strong>: node.dot.notation</li>
</ul>


<p>I usually refer to this last as &#8220;dot notation,&#8221; mostly because I had no idea what else to call it at first. I still call it that as it&#8217;s an intuitive reference for someone who doesn&#8217;t know much Ruby. I read up on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_object.html#Object.method_missing">method_missing</a> in prep for this blog post, but it was a new term and concept to me.</p>

<h4>O dot notation, how do I love thee?</h4>

<p>Getting back to it, I <em>lurved</em> my dot notation. It was easy to type. It was easy to read. It was harder to make typos. I am the queen of typos. Anything that helps me make fewer is my favorite friend. Then Chef Summit happened and recaps happened and I was like:</p>

<p><img src="images/yutakeawaymaidots.jpg" float: left /></p>

<p>At first I was outraged that they were <em>oppressing</em> my dot notation and I was terrified they would deprecate it, which would make me sad. For a long time after that, I was just mad and still loved my dot notation and resolved to just keep using it anyway. This was the first time I had the urge to blog about it. I was planning to tell everyone to piss off. I loved my dot notation and I didn&#8217;t want it taken away.</p>

<p><img src="images/nocanheerz.jpg" float: right /></p>

<p>I mean, yeah, dot notation didn&#8217;t always work and I probably never understood why. I was like this when I first learned chef:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was having a conversation about consulting and how important it is to
not be emotionally attached to your solutions. As a consultant, you exist to be
an enabler. You help others succeed with tasks that, without your expertise, they
might fail instead.  As consultants, our value comes from a long history of
observing and participating in spectacular failures and fantastic
successes. We know what works and what doesn&#8217;t work and we can articulate the
reasons why.  But our value can be compromised if we can&#8217;t interact effectively
with our clients. This means checking your emotions and inner schadenfreude at
the door and working with clients to discover a solution that is practical for
their environment.</p>

<h5>BOFH</h5>

<p>Back in the day, I worked on a silo&#8217;d web operations team at a big retail
company. We knew how we liked things done and, although we might argue amongst
ourselves, we presented a united bullying front to the dev teams.  For example,
  we didn&#8217;t allow them to deploy apps into production when they came with the
  caveat of &#8220;you have to restart the app every night.&#8221; We drank developer tears
  with breakfast, and we liked it that way.</p>

<p>  Guess what? Consultants don&#8217;t have that luxury. I might also argue that
  internal operations teams no longer have that luxury, but that&#8217;s a blog for
  another day.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is partially a post for posterity because I can never remember the format of this when I want it and I have to search all over the Internets for it.&nbsp; And for some reason, it&#8217;s really hard to find with keywords.&nbsp; Possibly my google-fu sucks, but I actually think it&#8217;s a java developer conspiracy.</p>
<p>The first time I found this jvm arg, it was by accident.&nbsp; I was reading a page of comprehensive JVM args.&nbsp; No it wasn&#8217;t for fun, although I was enjoying it.&nbsp; I was on a gig to help a client get rid of 20 second garbage collections that were crashing their site.&nbsp; So I was reading through the page just to see what might be useful and I found this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>-XX:MaxJavaStackTraceDepth=&lt;num&gt;</strong></span></p>
<p>It was love at first sight.&nbsp; See, I know developers lurve their stack traces and exceptions.&nbsp; Truly.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve met some truly horrendous apps.&nbsp; You know the kind.&nbsp; They throw 500 line stack traces every time someone types in a bad password. Or you have an overrun team that, once an app is in production, they don&#8217;t have time to tune the app and so you are stuck with 2000 lines of stack trace for every exception, even though it only takes &lt; 10 to figure out where to look for trouble.</p>
<p>After I found this and used it, I had bookmarked the page of wonderful jvm options, but it was dead the next time I went there. So I ended up searching the internet for it later and found that my googling led me all over.&nbsp; I found a stackoverflow discussion where a harried admin was asking about it and a herd of VERY ANGRY developers jumped all over him saying things like</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you truncate our wonderful stack traces!&#8221;, and</p>
<p>&#8220;An exception is called that because it&#8217;s <em>exceptional</em>. There&#8217;s a reason for it and you shouldn&#8217;t truncate it!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh they were like an angry mob.</p>
<p>But I have to tell you, this arg is an admin&#8217;s best friend if you have apps in your care that can&#8217;t be bothered with proper tuning on the dev side.&nbsp; Often this was because a client had a contract dev team come in, deliver an app and then leave.&nbsp; There was no one to fix it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shame in cleaning up your log files so they are readable.&nbsp; It&#8217;s tough to actually dig into a problem if you have thousands of lines of &#8220;benign&#8221; errors filling your world.&nbsp; This option allows you to limit the damage done by excessive logging while still seeing that an exception is being generated. Of course, with all the wonderful logging packages and tools with filters out there today, this sort of thing is less important if you are filtering, but there are lots of admins out there with nothing but the CLI, syslog and vi even today. This post is dedicated to them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend challenged me tonight to write a brilliant blog post on tuning a technology about which I know nothing. Actually I don&rsquo;t think you can really do that. I don&rsquo;t think you can write a brilliant blog post unless you&rsquo;ve participated in some kind of failure/stress activity with a product.&nbsp; <p />Until you&rsquo;ve seen real life interact with your infrastructure, it&rsquo;s all just theories and beer.&nbsp; But after a long day debugging Chef code I wrote in a way I wish I&rsquo;d never written (no really, I don&rsquo;t want my name anywhere on some of this stuff!), I thought I&rsquo;d take a little downtime to read about a product I&rsquo;m utterly clueless about.&nbsp; Because that&#8217;s fun.&nbsp; YES IT IS.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a couple of half-written blog posts started this weekend.&nbsp;  Real wordy things about scrummifying your infrastructure and my  experience with it.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll probably get to that in a few days but I  needed to vent about my weekend of yak shaving first.</p>
<p><strong>Moral of my story:</strong> The story you&#8217;re about to read is not the worst yak shave ever, and the problem is not a <em>hard</em> problem.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all in a day&#8217;s work for any halfway decent sysadmin.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re seeing here is a small problem exacerbated by a combination of <strong>technical debt </strong>and<strong> inadequate tooling.</strong></p>
<p>Technical debt is a choice and can happen to anyone.&nbsp; Here the client allowed their configuration management to run away from them.&nbsp; They haven&#8217;t been maintaining their Puppet nodes and so don&#8217;t have a good list of what servers they are managing.&nbsp; They also let some config files slip through unmanaged.&nbsp; I generally don&#8217;t point fingers about it as there&#8217;s usually a sane tradeoff involved, but the first issue makes fixing the second one harder.</p>
<p>However, inadequate tooling does frustrate me.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve gone to the trouble of automating with Puppet and managing application configs with subversion and scripting, but do not seem to have considered holistic server management. The only way to perform administrative tasks is by hand on each server or with Puppet. This seems a rather gaping hole in long term planning.&nbsp; 100 servers is long past what I consider manageable by hand.&nbsp; But you read the story and decide for yourself.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a few clients that I keep in touch with and take on small projects from time to time.&nbsp; This has been a strange week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m technically full time on a project at the moment and I haven&rsquo;t gotten any calls for new work in a couple of months.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been quiet.&nbsp; Then all of the sudden Wednesday I had 3 different people contact me about work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />One call was actually for some awesome Chef work at a place I&rsquo;ve been before that I&rsquo;d love to go back to.&nbsp; It really pained me to tell them that I thought they had in-house resources of which they weren&rsquo;t aware and that these resources would be more than sufficient to Chef their project without my help. Sadface Sascha.</p>
<p><br />Another call was from someone I do work for from time to time.&nbsp; Their projects source my &ldquo;Puppet for Chef&rdquo; series, if 2 blog posts can be called a series.&nbsp; In my head I have a 3rd one on templates but haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it yet. This 3wk run may source some if I&rsquo;m lucky. I agreed to do some ad hoc sysadmin work for these guys because they&rsquo;re in a swivet, getting ready for a PCI audit in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The job: There are about 150 Centos 5 servers. Caveat: some of the servers on the list may be retired already.&nbsp; Examine all of the configuration files for ConfigServer Firewall, bring them under Puppet control. Individual node config sets are ok (ugh).&nbsp; All servers are running a puppet client.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same client.&nbsp; The master was at 2.7.9 last I checked, I think.<p />I have a mini Chef project too for the weekend, but I think I&rsquo;ll save that for another blog post.&nbsp; I actually wrote post of this post on Saturday morning and am just finishing it up. I haven&rsquo;t actually started my Puppet stuff except to wonder if they have some command line tools and think I&rsquo;d better get to writing some tcp testers and comparison scripts if there isn&rsquo;t such a thing.</p>
<p><br />I actually spent a chunk of time working on my Chef thing which was an exercise in frustration.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for a Windows Ohai plugin and the actual ruby work was a piece of cake. Testing has made me crazy though.&nbsp; Windows servers don&rsquo;t fire up as fast as Linux for one and they are a huge pain in the ass to interact with.&nbsp; On my todo list is an SSH server for Windows cookbook, unless my ultimate wish of hoping that all Windows servers DIAF happens prior to that.&nbsp; The ssh cookbook is half done, like so many things.</p>
<p>I also am not sure I understand the testing strategy.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t write any new code so I shouldn&#8217;t need to author any tests (relief).&nbsp; But it turns out I can&#8217;t seen any windows testing happening in the run, or at least, I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s not happening.&nbsp; It ran happily on my Mac and then I thought maybe I should run the test on the Windows box too to see if the output was different.&nbsp; It was different.&nbsp; But I think that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s no Windows plugin tests in there?&nbsp; Wondering if I missed them?&nbsp; I was planning to email the chef-dev list tomorrow to see if I can get some love.&nbsp; Unfortunately the time I have to work on pet projects is the weekends and the IRC channels were like graveyards this weekend.<p />But I digress.&nbsp; I also ran manual tests - you know, the kind where you do stuff by hand and watch the output? My Ohai changes tested perfectly sanely on my Windows 7 64bit workstation.&nbsp; They tested insanely on a 2008r2 VMware VM I had available to me.&nbsp; And when I went into ec2 to fire up a neutral 2008r2, I discovered Ohai hangs on gathering ec2 metadata when run from the command line.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; I hand-edited the ec2 plugin and the mixin/ec2_metadata to try and eke out some debug info but I got no joy.&nbsp; While the problem fascinated me, that was as far down that yak shave as I wanted to go today.&nbsp; So I put away the Chef and cleaned up the yard for 2 hours.</p>
<p>Now I guess it&#8217;s time to play with Puppet!</p>

<p>I enjoy independent consulting.&nbsp; For that matter, I enjoyed consulting for a consulting company.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been doing it in one form or another since 2006.&nbsp; I love the variety and the challenge that comes from never knowing wtf will be thrown at me on any given day or project.&nbsp; Some days it&rsquo;s terrifying and some days I want to slap people around, but I won&rsquo;t deny that I like it.<p />Currently my LinkedIn profile, a business card and a terse web site are all I use for self-promotion. I never lack for work. I get calls every week from larger businesses looking to recruit for FTEs.&nbsp; This is rarely something I&rsquo;m interested in.&nbsp; I dislike the inevitable silo and I&rsquo;m not able to engage in the cognitive dissonance required to believe in all the meaningless BS that is part of corporate baggage.&nbsp; So I politely tell all these recruiters that, while I appreciate the contact, I&rsquo;m not looking for full time work at this time.<p />Once in a while I get contacted by recruiters looking to hire for smaller startups.&nbsp; I always listen to the pitch for these because, if the right small company comes along, I&#8217;d probably go work for them.&nbsp; <p />Sometimes they&rsquo;re way off the mark with my skillset or with people who want a culture match - like the recruiter looking to hire someone to work at a social network sports startup.&nbsp; When I told her that, unless it was bicycle racing, I wasn&rsquo;t interested, I could hear the awkward just floating through the phone.&nbsp; Obviously these guys trying to use ESPN APIs and social networking to bring people together would have nothing to say to me.<p />I had a call in December from a recruiter from a brand new startup local to the area, using a tech stack of which I approved.&nbsp; They tried to set me up but it never worked out.&nbsp; The place was all chaos and key people kept going on vacation and one thing after another.&nbsp; Eventually I forgot about it.&nbsp; Until I got a call the other day from the same recruiting company.&nbsp; They left me a voice mail, telling me they had a question and would I call.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; I called them today.<p />I got on the phone with the recruiter, a new one, and he literally stumbled all over himself for over a minute, trying to spit out a complete sentence.&nbsp; He finally did and I nearly hung up on him.&nbsp; The conversation went something like this:<p /><strong>Him</strong>: &ldquo;ah, um&#8230;so&#8230;you know that company we were trying to&#8230;remember you worked with my boss last year and that company&#8230;.they um, were looking for&#8230;remember we tried to set you up with X company?&rdquo;<br /><strong>Me</strong>: Yes<br /><strong>Him</strong>: Would you happen to&#8230;.they&rsquo;re looking for&#8230;it&rsquo;s really hard to find people who are into startup culture&#8230;.um&#8230;.ah&#8230;they&rsquo;re looking for&#8230;.um&#8230;developers&#8230;.and so um&#8230;I was wondering&#8230;.if, um<br /><strong>Me</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know any developers looking for work<br /><strong>Him</strong>: Oh, um&#8230;right, well, if you happen to think of anyone&#8230;could I um&#8230;send you a followup email&#8230;just in um case?<br /><strong>Me</strong>: sure &lt;click&gt;<p />Then I sent an email to his manager, the very nice, polite and professional person I&rsquo;d been talking to in December:<p />&ldquo;Hi Harry, I would appreciate it if you could let your colleagues know not to call me for the sole purpose of asking if I know anyone looking for work.&nbsp; It would probably also help their delivery if they not preface their requests with &#8220;remember the job last year we were trying to get for you but couldn&#8217;t?&#8221; and follow up with &#8220;do you know anyone else who might like to work there?&#8221;<p />Thanks,<br />Sascha</p>
