<p>  I&#8217;ve seen this captioned image circulating all day on Twitter. For the
  record, I don&#8217;t think this picture is funny.</p>

<p>  Now I love me some snark. But I think it&#8217;s too easy to be
  snarky and mean on Twitter,  because there isn&#8217;t a lot of consequence and we
  tend to live within a circle of our peers who often think alike.  The snark
  factor often goes up around conference time when many of us are congregating
  in once place and competing to sound smart and funny in 140 characters or
  less. I&#8217;ve commented before that I think people are too often mean on Twitter
  in the name of being witty or complaining about speakers without ever
  thinking about what that speaker might feel if he sees that tweet later.</p>

<p>  So why does this caption bother me? I have a long history of unfiltered snark
  and smart ass remarks. Consulting since 2006 taught me a lot about active
  filtering and my introduction to DevOps caused me to implement additional filtering for the
  sake of my emotional attachment to an ideal.</p>

<p>  As someone who&#8217;s signed on as a big fan of DevOps culture, I spend a lot of
  patrolling my cynicism and preventing disparaging remarks from escaping the
  filter. I think when you espouse certain ideals, you&#8217;re responsible all the
  time for representing them.</p>

<p>  I sometimes see cynical, catty remarks about sysadmins or ops from people who
  can only have come from a long life of development and, even though I haven&#8217;t
  technically done ops in 7 years, I&#8217;ve been sysadminly all my long life and
  I am affronted every time by those remarks. Recently I heard a professional dev
  say to someone in a beginners programming workshop, &#8220;If you want
  to understand/master the install of the programming tools, you&#8217;re probably
  better off as a sysadmin not a programmer.&#8221; The guy who said is a super nice
  guy, but that remark still got a side-eye from me.</p>

<p>  If DevOps is a movement that promotes collaboration, communication, respect
  and friendship between functional teams, I don&#8217;t think a sincere proponent
  would post this kind of caption. While it makes some folks feel validated,
  it&#8217;s just fueling the fire that walls people off from each other.  I don&#8217;t
  think we can all get along when folks are throwing up cynical remarks
  perpetuating stereotypes of bad development practices.</p>

<p>  While there are many successful DevOps teams out there, there are far more
  silos in transition or bitter adversaries who haven&#8217;t yet heard of DevOps.
  I can&#8217;t believe that only some developers or sysadmins are capable of transcending the usual barriers;
  I have to believe that any and all are able to transcend them or what&#8217;s the
  point?   But it&#8217;s the more entrenched and cynical cases that will be the most
  difficult to move ideologically and emotionally and I feel that humor like
  this can only alienate.</p>

<p>  I don&#8217;t want to pick on anyone specifically because I see this kind of humor
  from all disciplines all the time and it makes me increasingly uncomfortable each
  time. If we&#8217;re actually going to all be in this together, we need to jump in
  with both feet. So I thought I would speak up for a moment and say something.
  If a thing can only be funny by being rude about someone else, maybe it&#8217;s not
  actually funny at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://financierpastries.com/">Financiar Coffee</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Cedar &amp; William, Downtown, Financial District<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Financier (roasted in Park Slope, Brooklyn)<br/>
<strong>Machine</strong>: La Marzocco &amp; Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: kind of (&#8220;It&#8217;s not working right now&#8221;) <br/>
<strong>Served in</strong>: 8oz ceramic cups after I asked twice for &#8220;here&#8221;<br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 9/2/2012</p>

<p>This drink had the potential to taste good.  Unfortunately the
barista had no concept of micro foam or craftsmanship. The taste is a little harsh but I can see
that it could taste awesome if prepared correctly.</p>

<p>Financier prepares and roasts their own beans and so I may come back again and
check as it has the advantage of being close to where I&#8217;m staying and the
subway stations are totally horked with construction this weekend. (n.b.
I didn&#8217;t. I walked to Kaffe 1668 in search of a sure thing).</p>

<p>The pasty case looks amazing but I won&#8217;t be able to report on that. The store
has a long bar seating at the window plus some table in the back. While
I prefer the dark hipster coffee shops, this is still nice.  The music is kind
of pop/r&amp;b dreadful.</p>

<p>Also, beware, a small cappuccino is really only one shot. They divide the
shots. When I saw that, I asked for the second.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: cap tastes good despite mangled prep, bright and airy if you like that,
PASTRIES!<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Inexperienced baristas, Split shots (who are you, Starbucks?), crappy wifi</p>

<p><strong>Final word</strong>: Beats Starbucks and the nearby Blue Spoon</p>

<p>Verdict: Noms. Seems like a lot of places in NYC are serving Intelligentsia
coffee.  While I don&#8217;t object necessarily, it&#8217;s nice to see a coffee shop using
locally roasted or even better, roasting its own.  My drink was mild and
reminded me a bit of Stumptown with it&#8217;s citric tinge. They heated the milk
a bit more than some places but it was still drinkable and I like my milk with
a smidge of heat so the drink doesn&#8217;t cool off too soon. I&#8217;m guessing they heat
to 145-150.</p>

<p>There are four small tables and a wall bench at this location, so the lounge
factor isn&#8217;t high.  However, the was an elderly man enjoying his newspaper in
when I got here and so I&#8217;m guessing foot traffic isn&#8217;t too obnoxious.
The shop is small and unassuming from the outside and I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed
except I got off the subway there and was looking for friends.</p>

<p>Fyi, no public bathroom</p>

<p>This was a quick stop while out shopping with a friend. There&#8217;s ample seating
and it&#8217;s a light, airy space. My coffee was ok, although it was a smidge
bitter. I&#8217;d probably have to try again to see how I liked the coffee.
However, it&#8217;s a great place, good for meeting a friend or stopping in and
they take their coffee production pretty seriously. I didn&#8217;t actually see
a menu anywhere although I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>

<p>They did have an adorable water &#8220;fountain&#8221; that offered room temperature,
cold or carbonated water and they&#8217;ll offer you a water cup no problem.  The
staff is professional and fast. This coffee shop had the most starbucksian
feel to it of all the shops I&#8217;ve been too, but I don&#8217;t really mean that in
a derogatory way. I just mean that they turned out product quickly. The
product they turned out was definitely far superior to anything Starbucks
will serve you. I still prefer low-lit, shabby, hipster joints, but I&#8217;d have
no problem coming back here.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast, good coffee<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: None really</p>

<p>Sorry, no picture. This was on the run with friends.</p>

<p>Macchiato is a local two-shop chain in NY. It&#8217;s a restaurant as well as coffee
bar and appears to have a brisk lunch crowd. Seating is small tables and
chairs. This was a spontaneous stop after having lunch with friends near Times
Square. We stood in a long but efficient line. I was alarmed at the amount of
milk they poured in my 12oz drink and thought it would taste more like milk
than coffee.  While I would have preferred less milk, the taste was still
sweet, I could still taste coffee and the micro foam was lovely.  The
temperature of the drink was fine without a sleeve and the taste was nicely
sweet, leading me to suspect they probably use local and/or premium milk.
I prefer my caps with less milk, but if you aren&#8217;t picky about lattes vs caps,
you&#8217;ll probably like it. If I&#8217;d actually ordered a macchiato, it probably would
have been lovely.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Fast service, lovely taste, great micro foam<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: Busy and lacking in attention to detail.</p>

<p>Final word: I would go here if I were near but wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to get
some and I might look around for something different if I were planning ahead.
I think 12oz cups are way too big for most drinks, but it did taste good, so
YMMV.  It makes me interested in checking out Fonte Coffee Roasters in Seattle!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bluespooncoffee.com/">Blue Spoon</a><br/>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, Downtown (Williams and Platt)<br/>
<strong>Espresso</strong>: Intelligentsia<br/>
<strong>Hardware</strong>: La Marzocco + Mazzer<br/>
<strong>Coffee Art</strong>: No<br/>
<strong>WiFi</strong>: yes, from the park across the street (NY DTA), sketchy<br/>
<strong>Served In</strong>: 8oz cardboard<br/>
<strong>Drink</strong>: skim cappuccino<br/>
<strong>Visited</strong>: 8/31/2012</p>

<p><img src="/images/bluespoon.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a small shop at corner of William and Platt in the Financial
District.  The coffee is too hot leading me to guess they overcook the milk. I ate
half a bagel waiting for it to cool off. If I had been walking, I would have
wanted a sleeve, which I generally never need with artisan coffee joints. It
was interesting that the beans were Intelligentsia as the taste seemed to
have a lot more licorice or citrus than the other locations serving the same
beans. Reminded me a bit of Stumptown when it&#8217;s pulled too long.</p>

<p>Other, non-coffee specific: It&#8217;s hot in here. It&#8217;s a very small space and
I think there&#8217;s some a/c near the counter, but I&#8217;m about 8 feet away at
a window bar and sweating while drinking my coffee. Also, despite ordering
&#8220;for here,&#8221; I received cups with lids on them and a bagel toasted but wrapped
up in wax paper and a lunch bag.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: They&#8217;re 2 blocks from where I&#8217;m staying and bagel noms.<br/>
<strong>Cons</strong>: scalded milk, bitter, citric taste, location heat.</p>

<p>Followup: It was 90 degrees Friday afternoon, so I opted to walk back here
despite the meh experience of the morning.  I got the same kind of drink that
I think had even more milk than my morning cups. Very disappointing
experience for a shop that actually has a La Marzocco in residence.</p>

<p>Final word: Despite the La Marzocco, this shop is not serving artisan coffee
and I don&#8217;t recommend it. It beats Starbucks, but just barely. Intelligentsia
should investigate the crimes being committed against their beans in this location.</p>

<p>  <img src="/images/kaffe1668.jpg"/><br/>
 This coffee shop was recommended to me by a casual Facebook friend who moved to NYC
 from Minneapolis and used to be a barista himself.</p>

<p> Kaffe 1668 is a lovely little shop with dark wood tables and benches. It&#8217;s
 quite dim inside and I really like it. They serve espresso drinks and
 individually brewed coffee.  My cappuccinos were low temperature and actually
 cooled rather quickly as I was lollygagging.  However, they were very good and
 I enjoyed every drop. In a world where too many drinks are made with scalded
 milk, I&#8217;m ok with the consequences of low temps. The shop has cold pastries.
 I had a scone on my first visit and a breakfast sandwich on a baguette on the
 next. The scone was good, the baguette was chewy(I know nothing about french
breads so take that fwiw).</p>

<p> Your wait for coffee can be significant. The line moved a bit slow and it
 took a while for my drinks to be made.  However, it&#8217;s worth it as the
 baristas are perfectionists and won&#8217;t serve a substandard drink. On my first
 visit I was informed that my second cup was late because they were remaking
 it.   I understand they recalibrate espresso pulls throughout the day here
 which is awesome.</p>

<p> One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to be a stroller destination on
 Saturday mornings. It&#8217;s still worth it for good coffee which seems to be
 missing in most of Downtown, but cranky babies can be a bit tough on the ears
 in the early morning.</p>

<p> Bonus: They&#8217;re open on Labor Day. Guess where I&#8217;m going when I get up
 tomorrow?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has been percolating in my brain for a long time. I mean like, long. Ever since I <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style-Guide+Outline">read a snippet</a> from last year&#8217;s Chef Summit discussing best practices regarding attributes, I&#8217;ve wanted to write something. But what I&#8217;ve got to say keeps changing.</p>

<p>This post assumes some basic familiarity with Chef and node attributes. I assume that most people are going to be bored with the subject matter unless you care about nerdy details or why strings are the official preferred notation. You can get the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Attributes#CookbookAttributes-Notation">short version</a> on the Chef Wiki Cookbook Attributes page. I have a longer discussion here that focuses on my discovery process and evolution of thought.</p>

<h4>A Quick Attribute Notation Overview</h4>

<p>When I first started working with Chef, the publicly available cookbooks and wiki documentation were written in different styles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some used <strong>symbols</strong>: node[:some][:symbol]</li>
<li>some used <strong>strings</strong>: node[&#8216;some&#8217;][&#8216;string&#8217;]</li>
<li>some used <strong>method_missing</strong>: node.dot.notation</li>
</ul>


<p>I usually refer to this last as &#8220;dot notation,&#8221; mostly because I had no idea what else to call it at first. I still call it that as it&#8217;s an intuitive reference for someone who doesn&#8217;t know much Ruby. I read up on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_object.html#Object.method_missing">method_missing</a> in prep for this blog post, but it was a new term and concept to me.</p>

<h4>O dot notation, how do I love thee?</h4>

<p>Getting back to it, I <em>lurved</em> my dot notation. It was easy to type. It was easy to read. It was harder to make typos. I am the queen of typos. Anything that helps me make fewer is my favorite friend. Then Chef Summit happened and recaps happened and I was like:</p>

<p>At first I was outraged that they were <em>oppressing</em> my dot notation and I was terrified they would deprecate it, which would make me sad. For a long time after that, I was just mad and still loved my dot notation and resolved to just keep using it anyway. This was the first time I had the urge to blog about it. I was planning to tell everyone to piss off. I loved my dot notation and I didn&#8217;t want it taken away.</p>

<p><img src="images/nocanheerz.jpg" float: right /></p>

<p>I mean, yeah, dot notation didn&#8217;t always work and I probably never understood why. I was like this when I first learned chef:</p>
